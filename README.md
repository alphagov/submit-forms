# Submit Forms

Prototyping an intermediate format for describing government forms.

The goal is to allow forms to be created using a number of different tools, imported from a number of different formats, and output and run in a number of different ways, including, but not limited to:

* [Home Office Forms](https://github.com/UKHomeOfficeForms)
* [ONS eQ Survey Runner](https://github.com/ONSdigital/eq-survey-runner)
* [BEIS forms](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-forms-frontend)
* [Digital Marketplace frameworks](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frameworks)
* [Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFA)

The West Midlands Fire Service raised the need for a standard forms description language for their [low-code platform](https://github.com/wmfs/tymly) as an [open standards challenge](https://github.com/alphagov/open-standards/issues/51).
