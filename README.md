# Submit Forms

Prototyping a framework for describing government forms.

The goal is to allow forms to be created using a number of different tools, imported from a number of different formats, and output and run in a number of different ways
including, but not limited to:

* [ONS eQ survey runner](https://github.com/ONSdigital/eq-compose)
* [Home Office Forms](https://github.com/UKHomeOfficeForms)
* [BEIS forms](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-forms-frontend)
* [Digital Marketplace frameworks](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frameworks)
* [West Midlands Fire Service Flobot forms](https://github.com/wmfs/tymly/blob/master/plugins/flobot-forms-plugin/test/fixtures/blueprints/forms/forms/simple-form.json)

and formats such as:

* [XForms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XForms)
* [LimeSurvey form](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Exporting_a_survey_structure)
* [Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFA)
* [Angular schema form](http://schemaform.io/)
* [React schema form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form)
* [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/)
* [Tellform](https://www.tellform.com/)

The need for a standard forms description language has been raised by the West Midlands Fire service as an [open standards challenge](https://github.com/alphagov/open-standards/issues/51) for government.
